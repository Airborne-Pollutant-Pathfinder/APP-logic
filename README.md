# Airborne Pollutant Pathfinder (APP)

An Android application that enables users to navigate from point A to point B while considering
their allergies and pollen count in different locations.

## Setup

1. Add the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to your environment variables. IntelliJ has native support for this if 
   you edit the configuration settings. More detailed information on how to add environment
   variables to your IntelliJ run configurations can be found 
   [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/objc/add-environment-variables-and-program-arguments.html#add-environment-variables).

**Note:** `AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_MAPS_SHARED_KEY_ID` are now deprecated and no 
longer needed.
